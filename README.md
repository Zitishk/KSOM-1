# KSOM-1
To run the code on our custom image execute run_implementation with default values by setting input as 0

Default values are as follows:first 2 inputs as 512, next two (grid dimensions) as 30, bands=31, iterations=100,lr=0.4 and sigma=5.

Set URL as 'https://github.com/Zitishk/KSOM/blob/main/watercolors_ms_'

To run code on custom image
Set input as 1
Set the input dimensions as the dimensions of the image, output dimensions as user defined grid size,number 
of bands as bands of multispectral image, iterations (user defined), learning rate(user defined),sigma(user defined)
The url should be the starting url of te image and each image should be url+ number+png format.
